# PSoC&trade; 4: CAPSENSE&trade; liquid-level sensing

This code example demonstrates how to use PSoC&trade; 4 MCU, CAPSENSE&trade; technology, and capacitive sensors to measure the depth or presence of water-based liquids in non-conductive containers. Sensors located on or near the containers exterior provide real-time reporting of liquid levels. There are multiple options available that use low-cost materials to construct and integrate the sensors, while continuing to provide high-precision measurements.

The firmware continuously measures the data from the 12-sensor (12 Rx) patterns using the CY8CKIT-022 CAPSENSE&trade; liquid-level sensing shield and outputs the calculated liquid level over both the serial UART connections. The project supports water-based liquids using CAPSENSE&trade; self capacitance.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-liquid-level-sensing](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-liquid-level-sensing)" application with the desired name "CAPSENSE_Liquid_Level_Sensing" configured for the *CY8CKIT-045S* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-045S --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-liquid-level-sensing --user-app-name CAPSENSE_Liquid_Level_Sensing --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Interface the [CY8CKIT-022 CAPSENSE&trade; Liquid Level Sensing Shield](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-022/) to the kit by following the steps in the [CAPSENSE&trade; Liquid Level Sensing Shield user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-CY8CKIT-022_CAPSENSE_LIQUID_LEVEL_SENSING_SHIELD_KIT_GUIDE-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0efb9f891197). 

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's *Makefile* but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the code example title is displayed on the UART terminal, along with the available supported commands, empty sensor calibration values, and continuous output of the current liquid level in millimeters and percentage.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/terminal-liquid-level.png)

   
   The following commands are supported:
   - **stop**: Stops the data output over the serial connection.
   - **cal**: Stores empty container sensor values to EEPROM for calibration of future readings.
   - **basic**: Continuously sends the liquid level data output in millimeters (mm) and percent (%).
   - **csv**: Continuously sends the intermediate computation values and liquid levels in CSV format. The CSV format supports easy terminal emulator logging and data analysis using a spreadsheet or other tools.
   - **[Enter]**: Provides the next set of level values from the sample array.
   - **Reset**: Resets the sample array pointer to zero

6. Run the `cal` command to recalibrate the liquid level for an empty container. Change the liquid levels in the container and observe that the corresponding liquid levels are displayed in the UART terminal.

7. To fine tune the liquid level sensor, enable the `CAPSENSE_TUNER_EN` macro in the *main.c* file and follow the steps in the [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseTuner).

> **Note:** Currently, the liquid level measured in this code example is not precise. The water level displayed on the UART terminal and that on the sensor's label will differ slightly. This will be resolved in a future version of this code example.


> **Note:** The array `int16_t sensorLimits[]` holds the maximum rawcounts of each capacitive sensor. These values need to be changed if the CAPSENSE is re-tuned.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.
